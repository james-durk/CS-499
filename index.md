## Code Review

### Overview

As part of the enhancement process for this portfolio, I conducted a code review of the artifacts selected for enhancement. The purpose of this review was to evaluate existing functionality, identify potential areas for improvement, and plan enhancements aligned with the course outcomes of CS-499.

### Summary of Review

- **Existing Functionality:** Describes the original purpose and behavior of each artifact before enhancement.
- **Code Analysis:** Identified improvements needed in structure, logic, maintainability, security, and efficiency.
- **Planned Enhancements:** Each enhancement aligned with one of the three categories:
  - Software Design & Engineering
  - Algorithms & Data Structures
  - Databases

## Artifact 1: Software Design & Engineering

### Artifact Narrative

The artifact I selected for the Software Design and Engineering category is a Pythonbased text adventure game originally developed in IT-140, Intro to Scripting. The game presents
a menu-driven narrative in which users explore different rooms, interact with the environment,
and collect items to progress toward a goal. The original version was created in 2023 and served
as an introduction to core programming principles such as user input, control flow, and basic
object-oriented design.

I selected this artifact for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it clearly demonstrates my
foundational knowledge of software development and highlights how I’ve grown in my ability to
write cleaner, more maintainable, and modular code. This project is a great representation of how
I’ve applied software design principles in a real-world context. In the enhancement process, I
focused on improving the structure of the code through modularization, adding clear
documentation, and refining how the game handles user input and state transitions. For example,
I refactored repetitive conditional logic into reusable functions and implemented more scalable
data structures to manage rooms and inventory.

This enhancement directly aligns with the Software Design and Engineering outcome
identified in Module One. Through this work, I demonstrated my ability to apply software
engineering principles and development methods in the construction and evaluation of software
systems. At this time, I do not have any changes to my outcome coverage plans, and this
enhancement serves as a solid foundation toward fulfilling all related outcomes in the course.
The process of revisiting and improving this artifact provided an opportunity for deep learning
and reflection. One key takeaway was the importance of code readability and maintainability—
especially in projects that may be revisited or expanded over time. I also learned how thoughtful
modularization and design decisions can dramatically improve a project’s scalability and ease of
debugging. One challenge I encountered was determining how best to organize the game logic in
a way that avoided duplication without overcomplicating the flow of control. To overcome this, I
leveraged functions and dictionaries in Python to simplify the branching logic and make the code
more intuitive.

Overall, this enhancement not only strengthened the artifact itself but also deepened my
understanding of how strong software design practices contribute to long-term code quality and
collaboration readiness.

## Artifact 2: Algorithms & Data Structures

### Narrative
Narrative – Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement
The artifact I selected for this enhancement is a Python-based text adventure game
originally created during IT-140: Intro to Scripting. The game was initially built as a single script
where the player could navigate between rooms, collect items, and aim to defeat the Giant King
Crab after gathering all required gear. The navigation was managed through dictionary lookups
and the inventory was handled using a basic list structure. This version of the project was created
early in my degree program and served as a solid foundation for implementing more advanced
algorithms and structured problem-solving.

I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it provides a clear, interactive context in
which to demonstrate practical applications of algorithms and data structures. In its original
form, the game lacked any intelligent navigation system or strategic support for the player. To
improve it, I designed and implemented a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm that dynamically
finds and displays the shortest path to any item in the game world. I also refactored the game's
room connections into a graph-based structure, where rooms act as nodes and connections as
edges. These changes not only demonstrate my understanding of graph traversal and algorithm
implementation, but also greatly improve the player's experience by adding meaningful depth
and guidance to the gameplay.

The enhancements I made directly align with the course outcomes I outlined in Module
One. Specifically, I aimed to meet Course Outcome 3, which involves designing and evaluating
computing solutions using algorithmic principles, and Course Outcome 4, which highlights the
use of well-founded techniques and tools in computing practices. I believe I fully met both
outcomes by transforming a static, dictionary-based system into a navigable graph and
implementing an efficient search algorithm to solve the problem of item pathfinding.

Throughout the enhancement process, I learned how to design a modular algorithm that
integrates smoothly into an object-oriented codebase. I practiced working with Python’s deque
data structure for efficient queue operations and gained a deeper appreciation for separating
concerns—by isolating pathfinding into its own module. A key challenge was balancing
gameplay simplicity with functional complexity; I had to decide how much information to
provide to the player without compromising the spirit of the game. Ultimately, I chose to include
directional guidance in the pathfinding output, which required me to track both rooms and
movement directions during traversal. Overcoming these challenges strengthened my problemsolving mindset and gave me hands-on experience applying data structures in a meaningful way.
